Hello! Thank you for viewing my program!

Sadly, the CSV file is too large for GitHub to handle, as it has A LOT of data.

Here are the steps to get the CSV File!

1. go to https://github.com/Deepubhatt/Olympic-History-Analysis/blob/main/Olympic%20Cleaned%20Dataset.xlsx
2. Download the XLSX file
3. Convert it to CSV

Done!
